# COVID API
API for live information about COVID-19

Get the endpoint https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/all to get information for all cases

get the endpoint https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries for getting the data sorted country wise

an ionic frontend is showing the info nicely at https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/

 **This project is a fork from https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API (due to CORS and outdated code was not working)
